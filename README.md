# Welcome to the SUD- Smart Underwriting DashboardðŸ‘‹

This is a hackathon project made by myself (Aayan Shaikh) alongside a teammate at the hackathon "Hack the North 2025". 

## What is the SUD

In the field of insurance, underwriters are employees of insurance firms who decide whether or not to provide someone insurance by analyzing data about the insurance requestee. This data is often compared against what the company itself is willing to insure (appetite). With that being said, insurance companies lose millions every year because insurance submissions arenâ€™t properly filtered to their appetite. Underwriters are forced to review low-value or out-of-appetite accounts, slowing everything down. Weâ€™re solving that by re-imagining the RiskOps landing page â€” making it smart, visual, and AI-accelerated, so every underwriter sees the right risks, right away.

## How is the SUD used?
The SUD uses AI to review each insurance submission to verify whether or not the submission fits within the appetite of the company. The AI provides a score out of 100 points, and also assesses the risk associated with insuring a company. This accelerates the underwriter's workflow and saves time and effort. The SUD also has pages where the parameters that the AI uses to create the score out of 100 can be invidually adjusted to the requirements of the company. There is also a adaptive portfolio page that shows broad statistics about the company's financial performance with regards to insurance payouts, customers, policies, etc.
